		<h3>Bio</h3>
		<div class="contentbox" id=bio>
			<div id="portrait"></div>
			<p class=dropcap>
				By night I work as a freelance web designer, but by day I am
				a junior at Santa Clara University, where I'm pursuing
				a Bachelor of Arts degree in Journalism. I am on the
				editorial staff of two of the University's
				award-winning publications. I work at <em>The Santa Clara</em>
				newspaper as the Design Editor, and as the Production Editor
				and Webmaster at <em>The Santa Clara Review</em></p>
			
			<p>
				For the last few years I have worked as a concierge tech support
				specialist in Fairfield County, CT. I provide on-call support to 
				clients, and am able to help them with any and all issues on a 
				computer or electronic device.</p>
			
			<p>
				I run the typography blog 'prettyfac.es,' for which I write,
				edit, curate, and manage the theme. It features typographical art and
				news stories, along with features such as interviews with type
				designers and application developers.</p>
			
			<p>
				In my free time I enjoy playing and listening to good music,
				watching classic movies and obsessing over silly things like
				typefaces. I may get swamped by work at times, but I love the
				things that I do, and consider myself employed in some of the best
				jobs ever. However, if you think you've got something better, I'm
				all ears.</p>
