				 <aside id="portrait"></aside>
					<p>I am a junior at Santa Clara University in California, pursuing
					a Bachelor of Arts degree in Journalism. I am on the editorial
					staff of two of the University's award-winning publications. I work
					at <em>The Santa Clara</em> newspaper as the Design Editor, and as 
					the Production Editor and Webmaster at <em>The Santa Clara Review
					</em></p>
					
					<p>For the last few years I have worked as a concierge tech support
					specialist in Fairfield County, CT. I provide on-call support to 
					clients, and am able to help them with any and all issues on a 
					computer or electronic device.</p>
					
					<p>I run the typography blog 'prettyfac.es,' for which I write,
					edit, and manage the theme for. It features typographical art and
					news stories, along with features such as interviews with type
					designers and application developers.</p>
					
					<p>In my free time I enjoy playing and listening to good music,
					watching classic movies and obsessing over silly things like
					typefaces. I may get swamped by work at times, but I love the
					things that I do, and consider myself employed in some of the best
					jobs ever. However, if you think you've got something better, I'm
					all ears.</p>
