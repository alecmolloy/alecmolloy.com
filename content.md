# What is a product manager

A good product manager uses market and user research to articulate a product vision for design and engineering.

# Scrollnav

The scrolling navigation appears for users after they have passed by the home screen. It then reappears at the end of the site as an anchor for users.

On Mobile it appears for all users throughout their portrait browsing experience, and replaces the main mark.

# Portrait needs

The portrait should be taken in landscape format with the face in the upper-left rule of thirds intersection. If sitting, the torso and upper legs should be visible, if standing at least the torso should be visible. There should be a bright solid color (preferably blue sky) in the upper-right and upper-centre parts of the portrait.
